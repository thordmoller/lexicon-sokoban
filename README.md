# Sokoban (Web Version)

This is a web-based implementation of the classic puzzle game **Sokoban**, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no external frameworks or libraries.

Players control a character using arrow keys to push boxes onto designated targets within a limited space. The game logic handles movement, wall collisions, box pushing, and win condition detection.
